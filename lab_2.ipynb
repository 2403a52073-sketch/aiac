        "1. File Reading and Processing (try block):\n",
        "\n",
        "try:: This block attempts to execute the code within it. This is used to handle potential errors that might occur during file operations.\n",
        "with open(filepath, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:: This opens the file located at filepath in read mode ('r') with UTF-8 encoding. The with statement ensures that the file is automatically closed even if errors occur. The opened file object is assigned to the variable file.\n",
        "text = file.read().lower(): This reads the entire content of the file into the text variable and converts it to lowercase using .lower(). This makes the word counting case-insensitive.\n",

        "r'\\b\\w+\\b': This is the regular expression pattern.\n",
        "\\b: Matches a word boundary. This ensures that we match whole words and not just parts of words.\n",
        "\\w+: Matches one or more alphanumeric characters (letters, numbers, and underscore).\n",
        "word_counts = Counter(words): This uses the Counter class from the collections module to count the frequency of each item in the words list. Counter is a dictionary subclass where elements are stored as dictionary keys and their counts are stored as dictionary values.\n",
        "return word_counts: The function returns the word_counts dictionary, which contains the frequency of each word.\n",
        "2. Error Handling (except blocks):\n",
        "\n",
        "except FileNotFoundError:: This block catches the FileNotFoundError exception, which occurs if the specified file does not exist.\n",
        "print(f\"Error: File not found at {filepath}\"): If the file is not found, an error message is printed.\n",
        "return None: The function returns None to indicate that the word counting could not be performed due to the missing file.\n",
        "except Exception as e:: This block catches any other potential exceptions that might occur during the process.\n",
        "print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\"): An error message is printed, including the specific error that occurred.\n",
        "return None: The function returns None in case of any other error.\n",
        "3. Example Usage:\n",
        "\n",
        "with open('your_text_file.txt', 'w') as f:: This creates a dummy text file named your_text_file.txt in write mode ('w'). The with statement ensures the file is closed properly.\n",
        "f.write(\"This is a sample text file. This file is for testing purposes.\"): This writes some sample text into the dummy file.\n",
        "filepath = 'your_text_file.txt': This sets the filepath variable to the name of the dummy file.\n",
        "word_frequencies = count_word_frequency(filepath): This calls the count_word_frequency function with the filepath and stores the returned word frequencies in the word_frequencies variable.\n",
        "if word_frequencies:: This checks if word_frequencies is not None (meaning the function successfully returned word counts).\n",
        "for word, frequency in word_frequencies.items():: This iterates through the key-value pairs (word and its frequency) in the word_frequencies dictionary.\n",
        "print(f\"{word}: {frequency}\"): This prints each word and its corresponding frequency in the format \"word: frequency\".\n",
